    <h2>ES6 PROMISES</h2>
    <p>Promise is object that links between the producing code and consuming code togther. It is one way to handle asychronous code. To create a promise we use below Constructor syntax</p>
    <code>
        let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
            This is executer function which is invoke immediately after promise is created. It takes two callback function which is provided by javascript engine. They are resolve and reject
        })
        To handle the promise,
        promise.then(function(){
            Runs when promise is resolved
        }, function(){
            Runs when promise is rejected
        })
    </code>
