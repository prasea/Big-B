    <h1>Custom HTTP library using Fetch and Promise</h1>
    <p>Fetch which is part of window object is used instead of Ajax and xhr object which was in version 1 of this HTTP library. Also Promise is used to handle Asynchronous call from our application to the library.</p>
    <p>Classes are used instead of ES5 prototype and Constructor to make this library</p>
